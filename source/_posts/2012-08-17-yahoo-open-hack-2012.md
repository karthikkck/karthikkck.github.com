openhackindia2012 is my first participation in Yahoo!! open hack, and it was so much fun to be there with 700+ hackers around. I was in a team of 4 passionate coders. We all stayed up whole night and coded our hack continuously for 24 hours.

### What we did?

We worked on a travel related application which you can see here <a href="http://trippin.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Trippin</a> ( if link still exists :) ). We built an application which works like this.

#### User needs to input the following fields:

1. A place which user wants to visit
2. His/her departure date and time
3. His/her arrival date and time

#### What user gets from our hack in a single scroll free screen:

1. Weather report - weather condition of the place for all the days that user is planning to stay there
2. Route Map - directions on how to reach the place
3. Travel by bus - buses available to reach the place
4. Travel by Flight - flights available to reach the place
5. Places to Visit - tourist attraction around the place
6. Stay - best hotels to stay in
7. Restaurants - restaurants suggestion

All 4 members of the team were so passionate that we finished the application development in some 20 hrs continuous non stop coding. I love to attend events like this and spend time with passionate coders.
