Hello, this is my first blog post.
I started my 3D career when I was in final year of my BE course. I had developed a “Car Simulator” in JAVA using LWJGL ( Light Weight Java Grpahics Library ). From that time I am passionate about programming 3D stuff.

My next step was to apply my 3D knowledge in web. In this process I came accross many software out of which I used swift 3D and did a website which I pulled down recently.

In the course of time I just found out that webgl - a graphics library for web has been released. So I started learning it. The tutorial that I found for this is
[learningwebgl.com](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/)

learningwebgl.com teaches all the basic knowledge on coding 3d objects using javascript. Right now I have completed first 5 lessons on webgl and I wanted to get into a structured way of coding in webgl.

Accidently one of my friend forced me to go through backbone.js tutorial which took my attention at the first go and I am in course of setting up a system (backbone.js inside rails) and integrating first 5 lessons on learningwebgl.com into the system.
